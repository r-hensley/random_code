This program simulates perfect hangman by calculating at each step the most common letters of just the remaining possible words, and then plays hangman. 

In the end, it calculates using its own method which words took the most amount of guesses to guess. If at least one human ever looks at this page I'll be content, it was a fun project to do.

For testing, the least common letters at four letters are "q, z, x, j, v, y, w, f, b", so I added the following words to the wordlist:
qzxj
qzxjv
qzxjvy
qzxjvyw
qzxjvywf
qzxjvywfb

The results I got were: 
Word length: 4 (823 total words), ... Most difficult (26 guesses): qzxj, ... Less difficult (25 guesses): jazz
Word length: 5 (842 total words), ... Most difficult (26 guesses): qzxjv, ... Less difficult (25 guesses): knife
Word length: 6 (791 total words), ... Most difficult (23 guesses): qzxjvy, ... Less difficult (22 guesses): useful, evolve, mm-hmm, behave
Word length: 7 (709 total words), ... Most difficult (23 guesses): qzxjvyw, ... Less difficult (22 guesses): builder
Word length: 8 (543 total words), ... Most difficult (24 guesses): qzxjvywf, ... Less difficult (23 guesses): judicial
Word length: 9 (376 total words), ... Most difficult (23 guesses): qzxjvywfb, ... Less difficult (22 guesses): publisher

Next I tried adding in a common letter, "a", to the beginning of all the test words:

Word length: 5 (842 total words), ... Most difficult (23 guesses): aqzxj, ... Less difficult (22 guesses): knife
Word length: 6 (791 total words), ... Most difficult (15 guesses): useful, evolve, mm-hmm, behave, ... Less difficult (14 guesses): should, sample, famous, jewish, silver, carbon
Word length: 7 (709 total words), ... Most difficult (16 guesses): builder, ... Less difficult (15 guesses): supreme
Word length: 8 (543 total words), ... Most difficult (14 guesses): aqzxjvyw, ... Less difficult (13 guesses): judicial
Word length: 9 (376 total words), ... Most difficult (14 guesses): publisher, aqzxjvywf, ... Less difficult (13 guesses): discovery
Word length: 10 (284 total words), ... Most difficult (15 guesses): aqzxjvywfb, ... Less difficult (14 guesses): background, psychology, presumably, journalism
